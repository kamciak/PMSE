    <title>Belief-Rule-Based Expert Systems for Evaluation of E- Government: A Case
  Study</title>
    <summary>  Little knowledge exists on the impact and results associated with
e-government projects in many specific use domains. Therefore it is necessary
to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of e-government systems. Since the
development of e-government is a continuous process of improvement, it requires
continuous evaluation of the overall e-government system as well as evaluation
of its various dimensions such as determinants, characteristics and results.
E-government development is often complex with multiple stakeholders, large
user bases and complex goals. Consequently, even experts have difficulties in
evaluating these systems, especially in an integrated and comprehensive way as
well as on an aggregate level. Expert systems are a candidate solution to
evaluate such complex e-government systems. However, it is difficult for expert
systems to cope with uncertain evaluation data that are vague, inconsistent,
highly subjective or in other ways challenging to formalize. This paper
presents an approach that can handle uncertainty in e-government evaluation:
The combination of Belief Rule Base (BRB) knowledge representation and
Evidential Reasoning (ES). This approach is illustrated with a concrete
prototype, known as Belief Rule Based Expert System (BRBES) and put to use in
the local e-government of Bangladesh. The results have been compared with a
recently developed method of evaluating e-Government, and it is shown that the
results of BRBES are more accurate and reliable. BRBES can be used to identify
the factors that need to be improved to achieve the overall aim of an
e-government project. In addition, various "what if" scenarios can be generated
and developers and managers can get a forecast of the outcomes. In this way,
the system can be used to facilitate decision making processes under
uncertainty.

    <title>Towards Active Logic Programming</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we present the new logic programming language DALI, aimed at
defining agents and agent systems. A main design objective for DALI has been
that of introducing in a declarative fashion all the essential features, while
keeping the language as close as possible to the syntax and semantics of the
plain Horn--clause language. Special atoms and rules have been introduced, for
representing: external events, to which the agent is able to respond
(reactivity); actions (reactivity and proactivity); internal events (previous
conclusions which can trigger further activity); past and present events (to be
aware of what has happened). An extended resolution is provided, so that a DALI
agent is able to answer queries like in the plain Horn--clause language, but is
also able to cope with the different kinds of events, and exhibit a (rational)
reactive and proactive behaviour.

    <title>Defuzzify firstly or finally: Dose it matter in fuzzy DEMATEL under
  uncertain environment?</title>
    <summary>  Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is widely
used in many real applications. With the desirable property of efficient
handling with the uncertain information in decision making, the fuzzy DEMATEL
is heavily studied. Recently, Dytczak and Ginda suggested to defuzzify the
fuzzy numbers firstly and then use the classical DEMATEL to obtain the final
result. In this short paper, we show that it is not reasonable in some
situations. The results of defuzzification at the first step are not coincide
with the results of defuzzification at the final step.It seems that the
alternative is to defuzzification in the final step in fuzzy DEMATEL.

    <title>Interactive Debugging of ASP Programs</title>
    <summary>  Broad application of answer set programming (ASP)for declarative problem
solving requires the development of tools supporting the coding process.
Program debugging is one of the crucial activities within this process.
Recently suggested ASP debugging approaches allow efficient computation of
possible explanations of a fault. However, even for a small program a debugger
might return a large number of possible explanations and selection of the
correct one must be done manually. In this paper we present an interactive
query-based ASP debugging method which extends previous approaches and finds a
preferred explanation by means of observations. The system queries a programmer
whether a set of ground atoms must be true in all (cautiously) or some
(bravely) answer sets of the program. Since some queries can be more
informative than the others, we discuss query selection strategies which, given
user's preferences for an explanation, can find the best query. That is, the
query an answer of which reduces the overall number of queries required for the
identification of a preferred explanation.

    <title>Network-based Transcript Quantification with RNA-Seq Data</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides valuable information for
accurate transcript quantification. In this paper, we introduce a Network-based
method for RNA-Seq-based Transcript Quantification (Net-RSTQ) to integrate
protein domain-domain interaction information with short read alignment for
transcript abundance estimation. Based on the observation that the abundances
of the neighboring transcripts by domain-domain interactions in the network are
positively correlated, Net-RSTQ models the expression of the neighboring
transcripts as Dirichlet priors on the likelihood of the observed read
alignments against the transcripts in one gene. The transcript abundances of
all the genes are then jointly estimated with a heuristic alternating
optimization algorithm. We demonstrate in the experiments that (1) qRT-PCR
confirmed that Net-RSTQ achieves better transcript quantification accuracy with
RNA-Seq data from a stem cell line and an ovarian cancer cell line compared
with the models without using transcript network; and (2) the transcript
abundances estimated by Net-RSTQ are more informative for patient sample
classification tested on the RNA-Seq data of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and
lung cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

    <title>Simulation leagues: Analysis of competition formats</title>
    <summary>  The selection of an appropriate competition structure is critical for both
the success and credibility of any competition, both real and simulated. In
this paper, the automated parallelism offered by the RoboCup 2D simulation
league is leveraged to conduct a 28,000 game round-robin between the top 8
teams from RoboCup 2012 and 2013. A proposed new competition structure is found
to reduce variation from the resultant statistically significant team
performance rankings by 75% and 67%, when compared to the actual competition
results from RoboCup 2012 and 2013 respectively.

    <title>Sensing Subjective Well-being from Social Media</title>
    <summary>  Subjective Well-being(SWB), which refers to how people experience the quality
of their lives, is of great use to public policy-makers as well as economic,
sociological research, etc. Traditionally, the measurement of SWB relies on
time-consuming and costly self-report questionnaires. Nowadays, people are
motivated to share their experiences and feelings on social media, so we
propose to sense SWB from the vast user generated data on social media. By
utilizing 1785 users' social media data with SWB labels, we train machine
learning models that are able to "sense" individual SWB from users' social
media. Our model, which attains the state-by-art prediction accuracy, can then
be used to identify SWB of large population of social media users in time with
very low cost.

    <title>Emerging archetypes in massive artificial societies for literary
  purposes using genetic algorithms</title>
    <summary>  The creation of fictional stories is a very complex task that usually implies
a creative process where the author has to combine characters, conflicts and
plots to create an engaging narrative. This work presents a simulated
environment with hundreds of characters that allows the study of coherent and
interesting literary archetypes (or behaviours), plots and sub-plots. We will
use this environment to perform a study about the number of profiles
(parameters that define the personality of a character) needed to create two
emergent scenes of archetypes: "natality control" and "revenge". A Genetic
Algorithm (GA) will be used to find the fittest number of profiles and
parameter configuration that enables the existence of the desired archetypes
(played by the characters without their explicit knowledge). The results show
that parametrizing this complex system is possible and that these kind of
archetypes can emerge in the given environment.

    <title>Turing: Then, Now and Still Key</title>
    <summary>  This paper looks at Turing's postulations about Artificial Intelligence in
his paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', published in 1950. It notes
how accurate they were and how relevant they still are today. This paper notes
the arguments and mechanisms that he suggested and tries to expand on them
further. The paper however is mostly about describing the essential ingredients
for building an intelligent model and the problems related with that. The
discussion includes recent work by the author himself, who adds his own
thoughts on the matter that come from a purely technical investigation into the
problem. These are personal and quite speculative, but provide an interesting
insight into the mechanisms that might be used for building an intelligent
system.
